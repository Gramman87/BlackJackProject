# Black Jack Project

## Description
The goal of this project is to build a simple commandline UI program simulating a game of Blackjack. Using enums to create and populate a full deck of cards and flowing through the "basic" game logic to finish a hand. I chose to aim for some of the "strectch" goals on this project, implementing a "Blackjack" functionality and allowing up to 8 players plus the dealer in the game. As detailed below the complex interwoven object hierarchy was a bit of a sticking point as I got started, certainly not as simple as spouting off some data about jets... or spewing out some print lines. These objects were vastly different from each other either in reality or in functionality. Being certain about who owned what and who used what made progress very slow until these relationships were deeply understood.

## Lessons Learned
Going into this project I did not think it was going to be nearly as challenging as it turned out to be. The pure logic of the game was not the issue although it was rather complex. The largest struggle for myself was planning out the scope and organization of my classes with a functional hierarchy while observing and preserving the pillars of OOP. Once I got all my object inheritance and data encapsulation straightened out I made relatively short work of the supporting methods passing around and pulling data to function the game logic.
